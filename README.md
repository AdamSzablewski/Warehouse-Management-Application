# Warehouse Management API

Welcome to the Warehouse Management API repository! This API provides functionality for managing orders and automating restocking processes to ensure optimal stock levels in your warehouse. Additionally, it offers features to streamline the purchase order confirmation and delivery date calculation.

## Features

### Order Management

The API allows you to create and manage orders efficiently. You can place new orders, track their status, and retrieve order details. The order management features include:

- Placing orders: Submitting new orders with the necessary information such as customer details, product quantities, and delivery preferences.
- Order tracking: Monitoring the status of orders to keep track of their progress, from placement to delivery.
- Order details: Retrieving detailed information about orders, including customer information, product details, and delivery dates.

### Automatic Restocking

The API automates the restocking process by automatically generating purchase orders to contracted vendors for the required products. This ensures that the stock quantity always remains above the minimum level defined for each product. Key features of the automatic restocking functionality include:

- Stock monitoring: Constantly monitoring the stock levels of products in the warehouse.
- Reorder threshold: Determining the minimum stock level for each product that triggers the restocking process.
- Purchase order generation: Automatically creating purchase orders for the missing quantity of products that fall below the reorder threshold.
- Vendor integration: Seamless integration with contracted vendors to streamline the restocking process.
- Purchase order tracking: Monitoring the status of purchase orders and providing updates on their progress.

### Purchase Order Confirmation and Delivery Date Calculation

The API includes functionality to provide purchase order confirmations to buyers along with calculated delivery dates. However, please note that the API does not directly send emails. Instead, it provides the necessary data and functionality up to the point of a possible API call service that handles email communication. Key aspects of this functionality include:

- Confirmation notifications: The API generates purchase order confirmations containing all relevant information.
- Delivery date calculation: The API calculates the estimated delivery date based on factors such as product availability, vendor delivery schedules, and shipping options.
- Data availability: The API provides the necessary data, including the confirmed purchase order details and the calculated delivery date, for further processing by an email service or other communication mechanism.
- Integration flexibility: You can integrate the API with an external email service or utilize the provided data to implement your own email sending mechanism as per your specific requirements.

### JWT Authentication and Authorization

The Warehouse Management API incorporates JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication and authorization mechanisms to secure the endpoints and protect sensitive data. With JWT, you can ensure that only authorized users can access the API and perform specific actions. Features of JWT authentication and authorization in the API include user authentication, token-based authorization, secure token transmission, token expiration and renewal, and fine-grained access control.
